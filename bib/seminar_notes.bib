Abstract. The box product of Mackey functors has been studied extensively in Lewis’s notes. As shown in Thevenaz and Webb’s paper, a Mackey functor may be identified with a module over a certain algebra, called the Mackey algebra. We aim at describing the box product, in the sense of Mackey algebra modules. For a cyclic p-group G, we recover a result from Mazur’s thesis. We generalize it to a general finite group G in this article.
Introduction
A Mackey functor is an algebraic structure, related to many natural construc- tions from finite groups, such as group cohomology and the algebraic K-theory of group rings. The study of Mackey functor in abstract began in 1980s. Dress[2] and Green[1] first gave the axiomatic formulation of Mackey functors. Several equiv- alent descriptions of Mackey functors were given by Dress[2], Lindner[3], Lewis[4] and Thevenaz[5]. Specifically, Lewis[4] introduces box product and Thevenaz[5] describes a Mackey functor as a module over the Mackey algebra µR(G).
In this article, we give an inductive description of the box product of two left µR(G)-modules. The main goal is to construct this box product explicitly and to prove that it is equivalent with the box product of two Mackey functors. When G is a cyclic p-group, we recover the formula of Mazur[7].
