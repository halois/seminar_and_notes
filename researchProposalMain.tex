My research focuses on algebraic $K$-theory of group rings and related topics such as Witt vecters, Whitehead groups and Nil-phenomena. My current main objective is to compute the Nil groups of some finite group rings using methods from the $K$-theory of truncated polynomial rings \cite{MR86f:18017}.
\section{Background}
Algebraic $K$-theory is a powerful invariant that arises in a number of fields in mathematics.
For examples, algebraic $K$-theory originally arose in algebraic geometry in the theorem of
Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, $K$-theory of a ring of integers contains information about number fields, and $K$-theory of group rings is related to geometric topology via the
Farrell-Jones conjectures (see, e.g. ).
