Abstract. The box product of Mackey functors has been studied extensively
in Lewis’s notes. As shown in Thevenaz and Webb’s paper, a Mackey functor
may be identified with a module over a certain algebra, called the Mackey
algebra. We aim at describing the box product, in the sense of Mackey algebra
modules. For a cyclic p-group G, we recover a result from Mazur’s thesis. We
generalize it to a general finite group G in this article.

Introduction

A Mackey functor is an algebraic structure, related to many natural construc-
tions from finite groups, such as group cohomology and the algebraic K-theory of
group rings. The study of Mackey functor in abstract began in 1980s. Dress[2] and
Green[1] first gave the axiomatic formulation of Mackey functors. Several equiv-
alent descriptions of Mackey functors were given by Dress[2], Lindner[3], Lewis[4]
and Thevenaz[5]. Specifically, Lewis[4] introduces box product and Thevenaz[5]
describes a Mackey functor as a module over the Mackey algebra µR(G).

In this article, we give an inductive description of the box product of two left
µR(G)-modules. The main goal is to construct this box product explicitly and to
prove that it is equivalent with the box product of two Mackey functors. When G
is a cyclic p-group, we recover the formula of Mazur[7].
