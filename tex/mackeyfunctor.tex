George W. Mackey (1916–2006) was an American mathematician. For more interesting story about him, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mackey}, \url{http://www.ams.org/notices/200707/tx070700824p.pdf} or \url{http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mackey.html}. And I found an interesting fact that Leslie Lamport's advisor Richard Palais was a PhD student of him.\footnote{\url{http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=35871}} And Lamport is best known for the system \LaTeX.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport}}


Mackey functor is an algebraic structure, related to many constructions from finite groups, such as group cohomology and the algebraic $K$-theory of group rings.

History: began in 1980s\\
People:  Dress and Green first gave the axiomatic formulation of Mackey functors.
